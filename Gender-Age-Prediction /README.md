1. **Importing Libraries**

import cv2  
import math  
import argparse  

cv2 is used for image and video processing with OpenCV.  
math includes mathematical operations if required.  
argparse helps handle command-line arguments for flexibility.

2. **Highlighting Faces**

def highlightFace(net, frame, conf_threshold=0.7):  
    ...  
    return frameOpencvDnn, faceBoxes  

This function identifies faces in an input image (frame) using a pre-trained network (net).  
Steps inside the function:  
- Preprocesses the image into a blob.  
- Sends the blob as input to the network to get detection results.  
- Extracts and marks faces above a confidence threshold (conf_threshold) with bounding boxes.  
- Returns the modified frame and a list of face box coordinates.

3. **Model Files and Configuration**

Paths to pre-trained models are defined:  

faceProto, faceModel, ageProto, ageModel, genderProto, genderModel  

These files include the structure and weights for face detection, age classification, and gender classification.

Pre-trained Model Characteristics:  
- Face detection: opencv_face_detector.pbtxt and opencv_face_detector_uint8.pb.  
- Age prediction: age_deploy.prototxt and age_net.caffemodel.  
- Gender prediction: gender_deploy.prototxt and gender_net.caffemodel.

4. **Label Definitions**

MODEL_MEAN_VALUES = (78.4263377603, 87.7689143744, 114.895847746)  
ageList = ['(0-2)', '(4-6)', '(8-12)', '(15-20)', '(25-32)', '(38-43)', '(48-53)', '(60-100)']  
genderList = ['Male', 'Female']

MODEL_MEAN_VALUES are used for image normalization during blob creation.  
ageList and genderList are lists of possible age ranges and gender categories for prediction.

---

5. **Neural Networks Initialization**

faceNet = cv2.dnn.readNet(faceModel, faceProto)  
ageNet = cv2.dnn.readNet(ageModel, ageProto)  
genderNet = cv2.dnn.readNet(genderModel, genderProto)  

These commands load the pre-trained neural networks for face, age, and gender detection.

---

6. **Video Capture**

video = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  
padding = 20  

Initiates video capturing.  
- 0 uses the default webcam as the input source.  
- padding adds margins around detected face regions for more accurate processing.

---

7. **Face Detection Loop**

while cv2.waitKey(1) < 0:  
    ...  
    if not hasFrame:  
        break  

Continuously captures frames from the video stream and processes them for face detection.  
Breaks the loop if no frames are available (e.g., end of video).

---

8. **Face Region Extraction**

face = frame[max(0, faceBox[1] - padding): min(faceBox[3] + padding, frame.shape[0] - 1),  
             max(0, faceBox[0] - padding): min(faceBox[2] + padding, frame.shape[1] - 1)]

Extracts the face region using bounding box coordinates, including padding for better visibility.

---

9. **Gender and Age Prediction**

blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(face, 1.0, (227, 227), MODEL_MEAN_VALUES, swapRB=False)

Gender Prediction:  
Passes the blob through the gender network and selects the predicted gender category.  

Age Prediction:  
Passes the blob through the age network and selects the predicted age category.

---

10. **Results Overlay**

cv2.putText(resultImg, f'{gender}, {age}', (faceBox[0], faceBox[1] - 10), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.8, (0, 255, 255), 2, cv2.LINE_AA)

Displays the predicted gender and age over the detected face in the result image.

---

11. **Display and Cleanup**

cv2.imshow("Age and Gender Detection", resultImg)  
video.release()  
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
